# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and more.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training & evaluation
- Model saving using Joblib
- Real-time prediction integrated with Streamlit
